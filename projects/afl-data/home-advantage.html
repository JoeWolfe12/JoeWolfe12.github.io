  <h1>Home Ground Advantage: How Much Does It Matter?</h1>
  <p>
    Our initial analysis showed that home ground advantage is important, so I’ll need to build some aspect of it into my overall AFL predictive model. But to do so, I needed to answer a few key questions:
    <ul>
      <li>Can we quantify home ground advantage?</li>
      <li>Does it exist when the away team is from the same state?</li>
      <li>Does the advantage increase with distance travelled?</li>
      <li>How many points is home ground advantage worth?</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    To answer these, I built out a dataframe with new features:
    <ul>
      <li>Whether a game was home vs. interstate or intrastate opposition</li>
      <li>The distance travelled (using city location—so, e.g., Melbourne vs. Melbourne = 0)</li>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> I treated Geelong as interstate for this analysis, as they have a dedicated home ground outside Melbourne</li>
      <li>Teams playing frequent games at a neutral venue (e.g., Darwin, Tasmania) were considered to have "home" status for those matches</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Key Results</h2>
  <p>
    The data lines up with what you’d expect:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Category</th>
        <th>Home Win Rate (%)</th>
        <th>Avg Home Margin (pts)</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>All games</td><td>57.0</td><td>+6.7</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Interstate</td><td>58.8</td><td>+8.5</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Not Interstate</td><td>52.5</td><td>+2.0</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    Home teams (excluding neutral venues) win 57% of the time, but <strong>most of this advantage comes from interstate travel</strong>.
    When the away team travels interstate, the home team gains an average margin of 8.5 points. Against intrastate opponents, the advantage drops to just 2 points.
  </p>

  <h2>Does Distance Matter?</h2>
  <p>
    Regression analysis found that <strong>distance travelled</strong> and <strong>neutral venue</strong> both had large p-values—meaning they are not statistically significant predictors of home margin.

  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Home ground advantage in the AFL is real, but almost entirely explained by interstate travel. Now that I’ve quantified this, I can move on to the next set of features for the predictive model.
