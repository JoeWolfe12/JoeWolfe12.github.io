      <h1>Detailed Player Impact Model Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        This is the detailed analysis on how I built out a model to predict the winner of a footy game through player impact scores.<br>
        For information on the exact tables, see <a href="/projects/afl-data/model-step1-detail.html">the step 1 detailed model</a> or <a href="https://github.com/JoeWolfe12/AFL-data-analysis">the github repo</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's hard to measure individual player contributions in footy, and unfortunately many metrics are not publicly available. For what is publicly available, I was reliant on fan-made websites that store game data. The AFL website itself is built in a way that does not allow access to any of the actual tables of data: I can only assume this is to soft lock this information behind the paywall of champion data.
      </p>

      <p>
        The impact of this is that it's much harder for an amateur to put together a model, or analyse player stats like it is for a sport like cricket (statsguru being a prime example). There are some numbers I didn't have access to that could have made a difference to the overall model, so without dwelling too much on it, below are some of the metrics that were not captured:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Metres gained</li>
        <li>Position on field when different actions (disposals, tackles, marks) occurred</li>
        <li>Contests won and participated in</li>
        <li>Effectiveness and distance of kicks and handballs</li>
        <li>Position played during the game (not just the position the player is listed at)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Where I think this had the biggest impact was in being able to evaluate the performance of defenders. Not being able to pick up how many times a defender was beaten in a true one on one, or how effectively they were able to use the ball amongst other things means that the model will just to have some limitations.<br>
        In saying that, we did have plenty of data to work through.

      <p>Before building the main model, I quickly checked the raw correlation of each variable to winning. This isn't enough for good prediction but sanity checks variable relevance.</p>

      <h2>Logistic Regression by Role</h2>
      <p>
        Next: I used logistic regression for each role. This allowed me to see what stats had the biggest impact on winning for a given position.

      <details class="table-accordion">

    if len(pgs_role) < 50: continue
    X = pgs_role[stat_cols].fillna(0)
    y = pgs_role['won']
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
    model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
    model.fit(X_scaled, y)
    coefs = pd.Series(model.coef_[0], index=stat_cols)
    coefs = coefs.sort_values(key=np.abs, ascending=False)

      <h2>Polynomial Model</h2>
      <p>
        The next step was polynomial regression with L1 regularisation. This allows the model to use combinations of variables, but prevents overfitting by zeroing less important ones. This model takes much longer to train.

      <p>
        In summary: The polynomial player model provides a small boost in predictive power (roughly +2% accuracy) compared to a basic logistic version. That's not massive, and comes at a big cost in complexity and runtime. Further analysis is needed, especially combining this with top-down factors like age and ground advantage.<br>
        <br>
        <i>
          Next: I'll look at age profiles and home ground advantage—two variables that were highly relevant in the simpler first model.
        </i>
