  <h1>AFL Data Analysis Project</h1>
  <p>
    AFL (or 'footy', as I will call it from here on in) is the most beautiful game ever played or created.
    It is also one of the harder sports to analyse from a purely statistical perspective. This project is my attempt at being able to stare into the chaotic abyss that is footy, and have the truth stare back at me.
